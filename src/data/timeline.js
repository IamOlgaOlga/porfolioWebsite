I moved to another country to live in and solved many related issues. Just like my stress-resistant personality, I developed my management skills well. Most importantly, I acquired new and improved existing skills â€” such as frontend development skills, problem-solving, system design, management skills, etc. I seek challenging opportunities now where I can fully use my skills to meet personal and organizational goals.'
