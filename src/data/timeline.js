        details: 'I worked on one of the core payment teams. I developed a reverse-proxy service responsible for mobile clients applications\' integrity and security vulnerability checks and a part Mobile API which unlocked integrations with Android/iOS applications. This project unblocked signing of multiple contracts for the company. I led a team of 6 developers/test engineers and 2 analysts on several cross-functional projects which added support of different payment platforms. This included team and department roadmap planning, team staffing, mentorship of junior and middle engineers, cross-team collaboration with Security, Legal, Product and Design teams. Implementing these projects opened new streams of customers from LATAM and EMEA regions and increased department ARR.'

        details: 'I worked on a storage array sizing tool. I improved and updated the configuration and sizing algorithm to cover new features of updated storage arrays. Apart from that, I developed a tool used for reports generating. These reports describe condition and utilisation of elements and devices of a storage array. This reduced the time of report generation (which was formerly done manually) from 2 weeks to 5 minutes. During this project I gained deep understanding about storage arrays internals and passed EMC SPEED Performance Guru exam.'
